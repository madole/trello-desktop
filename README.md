**Disclosure**

_This is a simple electron wrapper around Trello.com_

I was finding that I kept closing my browser or the trello tab during development.
I needed trello to run on my desktop like an app and it didn't exist.
I remembered electron can do this so I've set it up to point at trello.com/login and off I go.
